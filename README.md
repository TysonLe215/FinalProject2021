# FinalProject2021 - Tyson Le

Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.

- I encountered plenty of difficulties while working on my project, but I eventually found the answers to most of my problems by searching the internet as well as watching YouTube videos.
- I will say it was definitely challenging to make a (sort of) working game with the time I was given. There was only one problem I encountered, and I could not find the solution for it which I explained in my final project video located down below.
- But overall, I overcame most of my difficulties, and in doing so, I learned a great deal about the pygame library.
- I enjoyed making my first 2D game.
